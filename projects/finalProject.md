# Final Project
## Disclaimer
**Please DO NOT distribute or post solutions to this project online (e.g. public GitHub repositories). We take violations of the honor code very seriously.**

## Overview
The final project is open-ended and will be a group project with three members, except for two teams with four members each. Students are expected to design a unique robot task, defining input variables and a sequence of actions as the robotâ€™s output. For instance, consider a scenario where the robot is tasked with clearing a dinner table after a large meal. Input variables may include the location of utensils on the table, the sink, the trash can, and the initial state of the robot in the environment. The desired output is a robot autonomously performing the cleaning task and sequentially organizing items in their designated locations.

Note that this final project is open-ended, allowing student teams to propose projects based on their interests. To move forward with a project, teams must present detailed plans and convince both the course staff and fellow students during the in-class proposal presentations.

## Instructions
We encourage you to use the Kineval stencil and build on top of it to a robot task of your interest. In the first stage where the student teams are proposing their project, we encourage the teams to be clear about the following items:

### Project related questions to keep in mind:
- What **robot(s)** are you using?
- What **objects/environment/maps** are involved in the task?
- What **actions/sub-tasks/tasks** will be executed?
- Which of these are input variables?
- What are the assumptions you are making?
- Is this a long horizon task? If so how many subtasks are involved? Do you need a task planner?
- Are you doing a deliberative planning or reactive?
- Are you using Kineval? If not what else are you using?
### Team related questions:
- Does your team have experitise to take this on?
- What do you plan to show in the final video?
- Why does this project need multiple students? Who is working on what?
### Project planning
- Do you have milestones for your project?
- Is there a plan B (backup plan)?
- How will you track the progress?
- How often will you meet with team members?
- Are you going to show your progress to the course staff?
### Deliverables
- Project proposal slides - 04/14 due.
- Final project proposal presentation (in-class) - 04/16 and 04/21 and 04/23.
- Poster PDF upload - 04/30.

## Overview

For this assignment, you will implement localization using a Kalman Filter on a real robot. This is a group assignment, and you will be required to attend two tutorial sessions as a group.

#### **NOTE: Your whole group will not be graded if any member of the group is missing from the tutorial sessions. Every member of the team must be present for the entire session to receive points for the assignment.**

## Instructions

For the assignment, you will book slots on the provided sheet to attend the tutorial session as a group.

- **Tutorial 1** will be a presentation by the course staff to familiarize you with using the TurtleBot robot. You will be running code on the real robot during this tutorial. At the end of the tutorial, there will be a take-home assignment, which should take under one hour to complete.
- **Tutorial 2** will be more hands-on. You will run the code from the take-home assignment on the real robot to localize it in a map and reach a designated target.

Location of the tutorial session: Shepherd Labs 164 (Drone Lab).

Please book slots for the tutorials by(7th April - Monday) here: [Link to SpreadSheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_nmUS7nNWcHEIy5-0pB4AAezCPIQM2s7VFOI9DAms44/edit?usp=drive_link). On the SpreadSheet you can look into the Sheet “Group Number for Reference” to see the group number allotted to your group. If you see any discrepancy, please notify us immediately.

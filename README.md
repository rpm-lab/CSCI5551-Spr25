# CSCI5551 - Fall 23 - Section 002 - Introduction to Intelligent Robotic Systems 

**Fall 2023 at The University of Minnesota**

**This website describes a course still in development to be offered in the Fall 2023 semester.**

The goal of this course is to introduce students to robotics principles, covering key topics such as 3D transformations, robot kinematics, forward and inverse kinematics, path planning, configuration spaces, sampling-based planning, basic motion control algorithms, and state estimation for mobile robots, which includes mapping, localization, and SLAM. Students will gain hands-on experience in programming robots in the [Java threejs](https://threejs.org/) environment. In later projects, they will have the opportunity to control real-world robots using their virtual counterparts using [ROS](https://www.ros.org/). There will be a open-ended final project where students can apply their skills acquired throughout the semester to explore new ideas. They will present their projects to a wider audience through poster presentations and demos.

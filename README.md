# CSCI5551 - Spring 24 - Introduction to Intelligent Robotic Systems 

**Spring 2024 at The University of Minnesota**

The goal of this course is to introduce students to robotics principles, covering key topics such as 3D transformations, robot kinematics, forward and inverse kinematics, path planning, configuration spaces, sampling-based planning, basic motion control algorithms, and state estimation for mobile robots, which includes introduction to mapping, localization, and SLAM. Students will gain hands-on experience in programming robots in the [Java threejs](https://threejs.org/) environment. In a later project, we plan to have a real-world robot challenge. There will be a open-ended final project where students can apply their skills acquired throughout the semester to explore new ideas. They will present their projects to a wider audience through a poster presentation with videos and demos.

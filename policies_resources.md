## Mental Health Information

The Department of Computer Science & Engineering strives to ensure all students have access to resources that will help them feel safe and supported. We are deeply committed to the wellbeing of all students, staff, and faculty. Your mental health is part of who you are and if you are unsure where to turn, we are here to help you. If you are encountering challenges, I encourage you to visit our department’s [Mental Health Resources](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/student-mental-health-resources) website and connect with one of our Mental Health Advocates, who are available to answer questions about campus mental health resources and services.

## Disability Information

University policy is to provide, on a flexible and individualized basis, reasonable accommodations to students who have documented disability conditions (e.g., physical, learning, psychiatric, vision, hearing, or systemic) that may affect their ability to participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the [Disability Resources Center](https://disability.umn.edu/) (DRC) to discuss individual needs for accommodations.

If you have already been working with the Disability Resource Center and have a letter from them to help direct your instructors on to set you up for success, then please send that to me at the beginning of the semester. In many cases, you will find that this course is already designed to be accessible for students that would benefit from additional flexibility (e.g., non-timed quizzes instead of large exams, flexible late policy on programming assignments, etc.). However, if additional accommodations are necessary, I will make every reasonable effort to make sure this class is a good experience for you.

## Acknowledgments
